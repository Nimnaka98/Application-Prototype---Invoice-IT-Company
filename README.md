# Application-Prototype---Invoice-IT-Company
I created this project during my studies. This is actually a sample website design from C# in ASP .NET(frontend/backend) for a company called INVOICE IT.
Created a database for store customer, staff details/view details/delete information. This website has two panels namely admin panel and server panel.
When the user logs into the login page they can see only their interests on the web page. And when the admin logs into the site he/she can access many requirements.
